# GitHub Repo Search - Angular Fundamentals

## Background

This repo contains a project I completed as part of Microsoft's [DEV314x Angular Fundamentals](https://www.edx.org/course/angular-fundamentals-2) course. The idea was to create a single-page application using Angular that would allow users to search for GitHub repositories.

## Features
* TypeScript.
* Creation and use of services.
* Creation and use of components.
* Creation of templates using directives and pipes.
* Routing.
* Observables.
* Unit testing with via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
* End-to-end testing with [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
